# Modeling-Math-Scores
Math scores in two Portuguese schools are modeled using OLS multiple linear regression and zero-inflated Poisson models

Within the European Union, Portugal has the highest high school abandonment rate of 41%, compared to the EU average of 14%. Furthermore, although Portugal’s students’ test scores have improved over the last decades, the average academic performance is still lower than OECD countries’ average. What could be the factors that are limiting students’ performances? Could programs be implemented that improve grades? In this analysis, the data—collected by Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva in 2006—contains math scores from two secondary schools: Galriel Pereora and Mousiho da Silveira. Our analysis of the data concludes that although there is no significant relationship between alcohol use (both daily and weekend) and academic performance, there are significant factors that can model both number of failures, and first period and final grades. With these findings in mind, schools can create programs that focus on the significant factors that affect grades and possibly improve academic performance.
